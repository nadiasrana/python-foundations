# Module 4 – Data Visualization with Python

This module focuses on exploratory data analysis and data visualization using Python.
It demonstrates how to visually analyze relationships, distributions, and patterns in data
to support data-driven insights.

## Tools & Libraries
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Pandas

## Concepts Covered
- Scatter plots to examine relationships between variables
- Bar plots for group-level comparisons
- Histograms to understand distributions
- Box plots to compare distributions across categories
- Pair plots for multi-variable exploration
- Correlation heatmaps for numeric feature relationships

## Notebooks
- `module4-visualization-lab.ipynb` – Hands-on visualization lab using the Seaborn `tips` dataset,
  including exploratory analysis and correlation visualization.

## Learning Outcome
By completing this module, I developed the ability to:
- Select appropriate visualizations for different analytical questions
- Interpret patterns, trends, and correlations in data
- Communicate insights clearly through visual storytelling
