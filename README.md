# Python Foundations for Data Analytics

This repository showcases my core Python skills as applied to data analytics workflows. It contains practical examples that demonstrate my ability to write, execute, and explain Python code clearly, efficiently, and reproducibly.

The focus is on foundational Python concepts that support analytical thinking, data preparation, and problem solving—skills essential for data analyst, data engineering, and entry-level data science roles.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Python programming fundamentals
- Data structures and control flow
- Writing clean, readable, and well-documented code
- Logical problem solving and iteration
- Translating analytical requirements into working Python solutions

## Repository Structure
- **module-1-basics/** – Core Python syntax, variables, conditionals, loops, and program flow  
- **module-2-data-structures/** – Lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets, and common data manipulation patterns  
- **module-3-ata-wrangling-foundations/** – DataFrame creation, data cleaning, missing value handling, and dataset merging using pandas and NumPy

This repository reflects a strong foundation in Python for analytics and serves as a base for more advanced data-driven projects.
