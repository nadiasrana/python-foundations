# Python Foundations for Data Analytics

This repository demonstrates my core Python skills applied to data analytics workflows.  
It includes structured exercises and practical examples that showcase my ability to write, execute, and explain Python code clearly and efficiently.

The work focuses on foundational concepts that are essential for data analyst, data engineering, and entry-level data science roles.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Python programming fundamentals
- Data structures and control flow
- Writing clean, readable, and well-documented code
- Logical problem solving and iteration
- Translating requirements into working Python solutions

## Repository Structure
- **module-1-basics/** – Core Python syntax, variables, conditionals, loops, and program flow
- **module-2-data-structures/** – Lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets, and common data manipulation patterns

This repository reflects my ongoing development in Python as part of my professional preparation for full-time roles in data analytics and related fields.
