# Module 4 – Data Visualization with Python

This module focuses on exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data visualization using Python.
It demonstrates how visual techniques can be used to analyze relationships, distributions,
and patterns in data to support data-driven decision making.

## Tools & Libraries
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Concepts Covered
- Scatter plots to examine relationships between variables
- Bar plots for group-level comparisons
- Histograms to analyze data distributions
- Box plots to compare distributions across categories
- Pair plots for multivariate exploration
- Correlation heatmaps to evaluate numeric feature relationships

## Notebooks
- `data_visualization_foundations.ipynb` – Hands-on visualization lab using the Seaborn `tips`
  dataset, including exploratory analysis, distribution analysis, and correlation visualization.

## Learning Outcomes
By completing this module, I developed the ability to:
- Select appropriate visualizations for different analytical questions
- Identify and interpret patterns, trends, and correlations in data
- Communicate insights clearly through effective visual storytelling
